/**
 * You are given an array of n integers, where n ranges from 2 to 200, inclusive. The elements in the array range from -200 to 200,
 * inclusive. Your task is to return an array where each element is the sum of a pair composed of an element and its 'opposite' element.
 * By 'opposite', we mean that in an array of n elements, the first and last elements are paired, the second and second-to-last
 * elements are paired, and so on. If the array is of odd length, the middle element pairs with itself.
 * The method should handle both positive and negative integers and be capable of dealing with an odd number of elements in the list.
